# mol

Mol is a project intneded to simulate the interaction of molecules by determining the resulting molecules from those reactions.

#features

- currently, the plan is to define every atom through the peroidic table of elements and add their properties, this kind of information will be important later on

- then you can throw any atom you want (maybe even create atoms of your own) in the simulation

- the molecule helper will be a tool that can be used to be able to eaisly add atoms into the simulation and also define the inital state of the molecules
-- this feature may be even more important in determining the result of chemical reactions later

- the end result will be a list of molecules generated by the atoms placed in the simulation

- plans to add optimization features like saving the result of chemical reactions for future use will be added

- in inital phases of the project, we will most likley be following as little rules about chemistry as possible, so if there happens to be bonds that make absolutely no sense, please forgive us

- project will most likley be hevily utilizing OOP given the it is a simulation

- project will likley be written in python
